Project : Fraud Claim Detection in insurance company

Detail : Build the best model for Fraud Claim Detection

I build 2 models which have different advantages 

kNN model : 
More appropriate when you want strict detection all most fraud cases 
and 
Admit that there is some policyholders who detected wrongly (False positive) by us

ANN model : 
More appropriate when you want less strict detection than kNN model 
and 
Want to balance between fraud cases which detected correctly (True positive) and wrongly (False positive)
